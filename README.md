## FlClash_CTIC

Forked from the original author's [project]("https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash").

The original project removes the icon color change feature because it may cause other problems. This fork adds back this feature through the history code of the original project.

It only supports color change on Windows, Linux does not support it in original code. For Mac, it's native supported, please download from the original project release.

This project does not accept any issues caused by this feature, please don't harass the original author. And if you support it, please support the original author.

At present, this project is not regularly packaged manually according to the original project release, and will learn to use the workflow to automatically package after the release of the original project.
